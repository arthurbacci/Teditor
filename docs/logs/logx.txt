Most relevant change: 3

1. Renamed linked_list.c to buffer_list.c

2. Moved filename from global scope to the buffer type

3. Added multibuffer support

4. Fixed calculate_scroll function, scroll is working again
   Reason:
           It was modifying only the copied data inside the function
   Fix:
        Pass-by-reference, also know as pointer :)

5. Added command 'close'

6. Now process_keypress and most functions that it calls return a bool, if it
   returns true, then ted closes

7. Multibuffer keybindings:
                            C-c: Close buffer
                            C-z: Previous buffer
                            C-x: Next buffer
                            C-o: Open file in new buffer
