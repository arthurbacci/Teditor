Most relevant change: 15

1. Removed PKGBUILD and Arch-specific instructions
   Why?
        - I don't know how this works

2. Changed struct names to PascalCase
   Why?
        - CAPITAL_SNAKE_CASE should be only for macros

3. Typedef structs
   Why?
        - Too many `struct`s is ugly and makes the code use more horizontal
          space

4. Hints now have a cleaner notation

5. TRUE/1 and FALSE/0 had been changed to t and f, respectively

6. Created BOOL_COMMAND and BOOL_SET macros
   Why?
        - Don't repeat yourself

7. `manual` command now can receive multiple arguments
   Examples: `manual logs 29-07-2021` will open docs/logs/29-07-2021.txt
             `manual a b c d` will open docs/a/b/c/d.txt

8. All logs in docs/ had been moved to docs/logs/ and `log-` have been stripped
   from their names
   Example: docs/log-29-07-2021.txt had been moved to docs/logs/29-07-2021.txt

9. docs/todos/ had been created, it is separated in docs/todos/todo/ and
   docs/todos/done/

10. Done todo 1

11. Removed old help pages
    Why?
         - Outdated
    -> Created todo 4

12. Renamed src/show.c to src/display.c

13. Created DEF_COMMAND macro in src/config_dialog.c for removing boilerplate

14. Removed cx and cy macros

15. Lines, number of lines, scroll, cursor... moved from the global scope to a
    the type Buffer, this will make it really easier to implement multiple
    buffers

16. Created the base of a linked list
